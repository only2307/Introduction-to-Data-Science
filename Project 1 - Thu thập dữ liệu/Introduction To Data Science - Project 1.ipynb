      " '        \\r\\n     This release is a very special one for us… Indeed, ROSKOW KRETSCHMANN has been for years one of the music makers that surprised us constantly and teased our appetite, displaying his rich musical background inside of projects like Jazzanova, Kosma or SYGAIRE…\\r\\n    The tracks selected by DAIRMOUNT (after hours hanging out in Roskow’s sound lab over the years) are genuinely outstanding in his entire discography. They sound like no others and reveal rare aspects of his “musical persona”. This is why they are representing perfectly our quest for “hybrid club music” crossing the lines of the original spirit of House & Techno.\\r\\n    \\r\\n    The EP opens with the futuristic Techno Soul of THE TIME IS NOW. Perfectly named, the tune fuses with class, dusty Jazz samples, obscure Soul vocals, juicy claps and overwhelming Detroit Techno keys. The result is a timeless club monster for the deepest moments…\\r\\n    The second track that blasted us is MONO:POLY rightly shaped for audacious dj’s that enjoy to play “special” things. The track is supported by a solid programming as fellow beatmakers like Mark Pritchard, Recloose or Kenny Dope originated in the 90’s, mixed with biting analogue pressure, crazy batucada elements & a magic breakdown for all the lucky ones that will play it in the sunrise this summer…\\r\\n    \\r\\n    And last but not least, one of the label mavericks, MARLOW created a hell of a remix by delivering a 10 minutes Techno epic that would make our Detroit godfather C2 blush of satisfaction… Thanks to all of them for the fantastic music…\\r\\n    \\r\\n    SELECTED SALES FACTS\\r\\n    \\r\\n        * Sygaire is the solo moniker of Roskow Kretschmann globally known for his work inside of the famous Berlin dj/producer team Jazzanova in the last 10 years\\r\\n        * Roskow has released his work under the names of Kosma, Intega, Rock Da Most and collaborated with Jesse Rose, Defcon (LSD/Disco Diamant) and Season (Dirk Rumpff) for labels as various as Raw Fusion, Melting Pot, Reincarnation, Front Room or Defected\\r\\n        * Roskow is one of the Hip Hop pioneers in Germany and released under Rock Da Most the first german Hip Hop production in 89\\r\\n        * Strong of successful releases on Freerange, Winding Road, Urbantorque and his own Dark Energy , Shur-I-Kan has signed one of his best remix work to date with his “perspective” on Sygaire’s The Time Is Now\\r\\n        * The Shur-I-Kan perspective has been introduced as a teaser on our first Perspectives release & became one of the most played tracks at WMC 2009. The mix has been charted & played by many since then & licensed for the next KM5 Ibiza compilation due this summer\\r\\n        * Weimar wunderkid Marlow, who is on the verge of releasing his long awaited release on Dennis Ferrer’s Objektivity, has turned Mono:poly into a percussive Techno epic of 10 minutes\\r\\n    \\r\\n          WHAT DJ’S SAY…\\r\\n              o ” More brilliance from my favourite new label!” - BEN MURPHY (Dj Mag UK, Clash Mag)\\r\\n              o ” The Time is Now is dope!

      " 'Following the overwhelming feedback about our fi rst release, we proudly present to you the RENAISSANCE EP by Berlin‘s HONESTY (known for his work with Daniel Paul as Slope on Sonar Kollektiv). Being his fi rst solo EP since 2000, we are thrilled to propose you this fresh perspective on Honesty‘s musical identity and to include him as one of our Room with a view core artists. In our book, he is genuinely one of these „unsung heroes“ of the German electronic scene that carries 20 years of dedication & experience through many sideways & projects, representing wisely an open source of musical horizons as wide as Berlin‘s, the city that shelters him since the mid nineties. \\r\\n                  \\r\\n                  The cosmopolitan fl air of Berlin & its club scene developments in the last 2 decades are only a part of what nourished Honesty‘s appetite for translating an already well furnished musical background. Honesty is a master in the art of creating „hybrid“ club music that crosses over genres & musical emotions. This EP is a jewel of „retro futurism“ opening with BRIXTON BEACH, a favorite of Peter Kruder, Lovebirds, Mark August or Sasse. Some would probably describe it as a mixture of Neo Boogie & Proto-Techno, somewhere between early works of Morgan Geist & Carl Craig. We simply believe it is some of the heaviest futuristic funk to be experienced today in clubs. \\r\\n                \\r\\n                The same applies to BLEEP ME, a solid prototype of moody deep house mutating in a cosmic disco trip. A track combining a subtle atmospheric climax with a relentless disco energy, that caught interest of dj’s such as Dixon, Jimpster, Gerd and D.Ramirez. The spacey & moody aspects of Honesty‘s music are developing some hypnotic qualities with the dubby house of STARTER SEVEN. A track of unrevealed power as long as you don‘t play it on a proper sound system... As part of the exclusive digital bonus of this release, HONESTY & Label honcho DAIRMOUNT have signed a common version of Bleep me staying closer to the genuine disco drum sounds of the track. A slightly more organic perspective of the tune... Honesty has also prepared an alternative dub version of BRIXTON BEACH for those of you who can‘t get enough...\\r\\n                            \\r\\n                            EARLY DJ FEEDBACK\\r\\n                            \\r\\n                            \"A great follow up after your stormer 1st release, keep doing your thing and you will be one of the best new labels soon.The brixton Beach dub is a killer too\"\\r\\n                            KIKO NAVARRO (Pacha Ibiza, Garito Café)\\r\\n                            \\r\\n                            \"What a come back for Hans, excellent EP full of adventure and bliss for the whole family...\" - SASSE (Mood Music, Misericord)\\r\\n                            \\r\\n                            \"Great EP...\" - DIXON (Innervisions)\\r\\n                            \\r\\n                            \"Fantastic release.

DAIRMOUNT & BERARDI deliberately wanted to bring their own persperctive on Hip Hop esthetics once pioneered by people such as DJ Duke, Pal Joey or Kenny Dope.

I just feel it might terrify my audience in a club! I will definately be spinning his mix more on radio, i know that will go down extremely well on di.fm.

These stories cover a wide range of themes intrinsically linked to the unique landscape we see today, all presented by a variety of local experts and accompanied by evocative and inspiring images of the South Downs. These are impassioned and personal accounts by the narrators based on their own background and experience. The audio files can also be downloaded onto mp3 players and are intended to accompany a number of walks in the South Downs where these themes are relevant.

      " \"In the year AD 802,701 humanity has evolved into two separate species: the Eloi and the Morlocks. The Eloi are the spoiled, attractive upper class, living in luxury on the surface of the earth while the Morlocks live underground, tending machinery and providing food, clothing and infrastructure for the Eloi. Each class evolved and degenerated from different social classes as humans, a theme that reflects upon H.G. Wells' sociopolitical opinions.\\r\\n    \\r\\n    The main difference from their earlier ruler-worker state is that while the Morlocks continue to support the world's infrastructure and serve the Eloi, the Eloi have undergone significant physical and mental deterioration. Having solved all problems which required strength, intelligence or virtue, they have slowly become dissolute, frail animals. While one initially has the impression that the Eloi live a life of play and toil less abundance, it is revealed that the Morlocks are tending to the Eloi's needs for the same reason a farmer tends to cattle - because the Eloi compose most (if not all) of the Morlocks diet and the Eloi are no longer capable of acting in any other role than to be eaten by the Morlocks. \"\n",

      " 'Inevitable Hypocrisy is a concept album exploring the inner turmoil and turbulence of relationships and interdependence upon one another from multiple points of view. Featuring keyboard-driven rock with complex meters and soaring vocals, the two main characters espouse their (often conflicting) views on life and human interaction. The album includes a twenty-minute epic instrumental, Cloudmaker, which incorporates themes from the other tracks in a vein familiar to progressive rock fans and made popular by bands like Dream Theater, Yes, and Rush. The gritty, compelling, passion goes from furious, driving rhythms one minute to crystal-clear solo keyboard lines the next. Songs like “Welcome to The Oval” and “Ignite” show off the amazing technique of a classically-trained pianist.\\r\\n  \\r\\n  The album’s heartfelt lyrics raise questions about life, our place in society, and human interaction. It is easy to identify with the album’s characters and their struggles, as they are constantly forced to re-evaluate the placement of their trust, and in doing so experience longing, brooding anger, happiness, and ultimately acceptance and peace. Inevitable Hypocrisy covers a very wide emotional spectrum and makes heavy use of musical themes and modes to establish character moods. The characters’ lives conform to patterns that are easy to relate to, yet the unique examples and situations encountered by the characters have caught many listeners off-guard.\\r\\n  \\r\\n  The album’s sound and instrumentation are truly unique. Featuring mellow pianos, vintage keyboards, driving drums, powerful synth leads and warm pads, it also makes use of instruments rarely-heard in progressive rock, including both sampled saxophone and violin solos as well as a Hammond Model A organ, spoken word, and other nontraditional samples. The wonderfully warm yet clear pianos include a Yamaha C7 grand and a Steinway K upright, providing a brilliantly-clear sound that can only result from well over a decade of piano performance experience.\\r\\n  \\r\\n  True to its progressive rock roots, Inevitable Hypocrisy showcases a complex writing style involving rapid key and meter changes, key-blazing solos that would make Jordan Rudess envious, recurring musical themes, unique chord structures, and tight lyrical/musical integration. Characters recycle melodies and lyrics from each other, demonstrating differing thoughts and perspectives on common issues. Themes recur throughout the album in different keys, modes, and meters, and tight integration of musical composition allows these rapid transitions to flow easily and naturally.\\r\\n  \\r\\n  Inevitable Hypocrisy provides a refreshing new sound that is accessible (most notably “Ready For Tomorrow” and “Less”), yet incredibly deep and complex. It explores our inmost thoughts and is unafraid to say out loud the things we often only dare to think in our heads.\\r\\n  \\r\\n  Drew Crawford has just graduated high school, and is a classically-trained keyboardist and vocalist. He will be attending college in Longview, Texas and is looking for a band that can handle the complex, challenging music he wants to play. He enjoys composing music for short films and owns his own computer repair business. Drew is a three-year member of the Oklahoma All-State Choir, an honor granted to less than twenty graduating seniors statewide, and this is his first published album.'\n",

Teaming up with songwriter and vocalist Rachel Skotarzcyk (RAI) a native of Detroit they have come up with a release that's quite a departure from Bellboy's previous outings. Closer comes in the form of three mixes which aims to send a subtle message directly to the subconscious reflecting the ever increasing Police State in the UK which has alarmed many. The Detroit mix which should find favour with the Deep House-Techno crowd for Its moody tones and sparse vocal making it a get down and become lost in the groove affair. The X Cabs Tech House mix is aimed at those who prefer it served with a little more action. The original mix is a highly infectious full vocal outing which according to our sources seems to hit the spot for the girls. RAI's presence on the vocal undoubtedly helps this release stand out from the crowd and shine.\\r\\n  \\r\\n  Cowie who has around 150 releases under his belt shows his diverse production skills which are currently employed in co writing and producing RAI's début album in Aberdeen and it was during those sessions they wrote closer.\\r\\n  \\r\\n  Cowie hasn't abandoned his unique Tech House and Techno sound.

We want everyone who comes to see us live to walk out with the EP in their pocket, no excuses!”\\r\\n    \\r\\n    Where live instruments, vocalists and beatbox queens collide with some heavy Zed Bias production, find Dekata Project. Already creating a stir in underground house and broken beat circles for their sassy and diverse 4 track debut, the “Viral EP” the Dekata Project build on their ever-growing live following with this buzzing EP that launches them on the international stage.\\r\\n    \\r\\n    The “Viral EP” features four different vocalists, kicking off with newcomer virtuoso Chloe Morgan on the summery “Change My Way”, which boasts some intricate jazz-funk harmonies a la Reel People and Basement Jaxx, with hints of Steely Dan. Singer, Natalie Williams, known for her Soul Family nights at Ronnie Scott’s, shines on the haunting minimal house reworking of the classic 90s indie hit Semisonic’s “Secret Smile” with swinging beats. The final tracks feature two of London’s hottest young vocal talents: Yvette Riby-Williams and Neo Josua, both members of Bellatrix and the Boxettes, the UK’s first all girl vocal harmony and beat box group, and are also members of UK beat box favourites, Shlomo’s Vocal Orchestra. Yvette’s up first on “At Least We Can Dance”, a live fave that’s got an 80’s groove going round a great break and chorus that lifts and lifts, guaranteed to get you moving with its unceasing beats. And rounding off Neo delivers on the haunting “Leave It” spinning a deep vocal over some techno slides that skim across taut keys and beats making this one of the EP’s essential grooves.\\r\\n    \\r\\n    Available for only £1, this value-for-money EP is aimed at buyers spreading the Dekata word via text, email, or networking site and available at all good sites and from Doshiwa Records (www.doshiwa.com)\\r\\n    \\r\\n    ...at least we can dance.\\r\\n    \\r\\n    “It’s a funny thing, I avoided taking risks in my life for so long, but ended up being miserable. I now wake up every morning an know that I’m fully accountable to myself: it is up to me and me alone to hustle for work, deal with the fear of the empty diary, and try and get the vision and motivation to get my music out there. It took a while to adjust, but I wouldn’t have it any other way.” \\r\\n    \\r\\n    Dekata Project is the brainchild of song writer, sax player and producer Sam Sharp. Inspired by hearing pioneering UK garage/dubstep founding father producer, Zed Bias on Radio 1’s Gilles Peterson, Sam tracked Zed down and two weeks later Zed and Sam started working together on the Dekata sound. Recorded at Sam’s Loose Wind Studios in Hackney, East London, and then taken up the M6 to Manchester to Zed’s Biasonics Laboratory Studio, the pair worked together to utilise Sam’s obsession with composing catchy hooks, funk stylings, squelchy bass lines combined with Zed’s knowledge of all things heavy, reflected in his beats, production and arrangements.\\r\\n    \\r\\n    Think futuristic disco, soulful house and nu-soul mixed in with influences from artists like the Basement Jaxx, Groove Armada, Daft Punk, Bugz in the Attic, Moloko, and Jamiroquai\\r\\n    \\r\\n    After chucking in a job in the city following an inspired Glastonbury weekend three years ago, Sam went back to university to complete a masters degree in Jazz Performance & Composition. Since then Sam has gigged around London with his Pack Of Six band (the precursor to Dekata Project) playing some deep soul n’ funk, and with a strong network of musicians and friends, he also runs the live jazz function agency, City Jazz. An avid jazz record collector, Sam also indulges his passion for drum n’ bass, hip hop and techno (an original Orbit clubber from his Leeds Uni days) he is also a conservatoire-trained musician. \\r\\n    \\r\\n    For more info go to www.dekataproject.com\\r\\n    '\n",

Both encompass Gray's vision of delivering a superb blend of funky bass lines, vocal snips, hints of spoken word with the occasional organ and horn lines that blend harmoniously to create a deep house groover that will satisfy a variety of listeners. Solid remix duties come from Matthew Random of Quirk Burglars and Chicago's Karl Almaria.  Mathew Random's remix of City Life is a stormer; Jackin, quirky rhythms and just the right amount of funk create a monster of a track that can work on many levels.

That trend changes with Another Electronic Musician\\'s latest album \"Five\", Jase Rex\\'s fifth release under the n5MD group of labels. Five puts the dance back into Intelligent Dance Music through the fusion of Techno, House, Electro, and Jazz with Rex\\'s now signature sculpted sound.

Romain Roqueta, know in the digital world as Sukdabeat presents us with a delightful record filled with pleasant electronic glockenspiels, warm synths pulled from various hardware material and tight hip-hopish beats reminiscent of some of the best and respected electronic artists around (e.g. Chris Clark). Struktur introduces us to the complex world that goes on Sukdabeat’s mind: the beats have an amazing attention to detail and will get you hooked right from the start; clicks, plops, distant bugs, multi-layered kicks and snares are the structure of these eight tracks. It feels as if we had just landed on a distant alien planet, but at the same time, this strange place felt strangely familiar to us. This is where the melodies pop in: immediate synths, pleasant sines, music-boxes, all of them rich, heart-felt and very accessible creating a curious fight between melody and beat [man/machine?], where both contestants win, to your own delight.\\r\\n            \\r\\nOnce you start exploring deeply inside this planet, you won’t ever want to leave.
